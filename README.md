Each of these functionalities can also be found in separate packages. So if you only want to use the sitemap functionality and the robots.txt functionality then you can do that!

### Meta Fields
Meta Fields allow you to easily set your meta fields like Title, Description, Open Graph Title/Description/Image and canonical URL based on already existing fields on your content node. This allows your users to see where the values are coming from and also what their values will be. At the same time your users can also change these values themselves, so not code is required.

### Sitemap
Sitemap gives you an sitemap.xml where all your pages are listed. This package works with multiple domains and languages. It creates a /sitemap.xml for each domain and also a sitemap index with all your sitemaps listed within.

### Robots.txt
Robots.txt gives you an easy interface to edit your robots.txt. After installing the package, you'll get the /robots.txt path that'll display your configured robots.txt.

### Script Manager
Script manager easily allows your users to add new scripts to the website. They are able to quickly add Google Tag Manager or Hotjar with just a few clicks. It also gives them the ability for adding custom scripts if their script definition is not yet available.
