            <h1>Licensing</h1>
            <div class="intro">
                <p><b>This package currently doesn't need a license as it is still in alpha. Below here you can find the information about the license when the package does release.</b></p>
            </div>
            <p>By default this package requires you to have a license if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have more than 100 pages (page is defined as content node with a template. Items without a template do not count towards this limit)</li>
                <li>You want to use the dashboards included in this package</li>
                <li>You want to make use of the premium components. There currently aren't any, but will be added later</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have less than 100 pages, then you don't have to do anything. The package will recognize this and give you access to all its features. If you do go over the limit, these features will be taken away from you, but any data related to them will not be removed. Buying a license, or removing pages will give you your access back.</p>
            <p>If you don't want to use the dashboards, but instead each individual functionality then this is also fine. This does however require some configuration.</p>
